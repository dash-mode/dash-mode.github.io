Subject: Letter of Recommendation for Mr. Dibyadarshi Dash

To whom it may concern,
I would like to offer this letter of recommendation for Mr. Dibyadarshi Dash. To do so, may I
introduce myself. I work on the Boeing Commercial Crew Program in Houston, Texas and have
supported the NASA Space Shuttle and Space Station programs for over 30 years.
I met Dibyadarshi at the Asian Space Settlement Design Competition in 2016. I volunteer for
these competitions and the event pits four or five teams (companies) in a competition to write a
proposal for an off-earth settlement over the course of the weekend. I participate as the CEO of
the mock company. At the Asian competition, Dibyadarshi was the Systems Engineer and
adeptly demonstrated his leadership, communication, and organization skills. As the systems
engineer, Dibyadarshi's most important task was to ensure all of the company's design teams
remained integrated which involved constant communications and resolving technical problems.
The company consisted of teams from India, Pakistan and China. Dibyadarshi successfully
integrated differences in perspectives and opinions. He effectively collaborated among the
company members on a variety of topics and technical issues. Dibyadarshi also facilitated a
healthy communication among all the teams. Dibyadarshi proposed the idea of using magnetic
bearings to allow the large habitable torus section to rotate and provide the needed gravitational
environment. This approach for the settlement enhanced functionality and fulfilled a major
requirement of the proposal. Dibyadarshi's idea received ajudges' "good point" mention which
recognized the innovation and importance of his contribution.
I fully expect that Dibyadarshi will continue to develop his leadership and technical integration
skills throughout his university and professional careers.
Please accept this letter of recommendation and feel free to query Dibyadarshi on the more
interesting aspects of the design competition.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Best Regards,
~
